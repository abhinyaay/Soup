#: The skip message for a ``gpu``-marked test on a machine without CUDA (#833).

    """THE one CUDA probe for the test suite (#833). Probed once per session.

    Fifteen modules had grown a private copy of this, and nine of them turned it
    into an identical ``requires_cuda`` skipif, so ``pytest -m gpu`` had nothing
    to select. Gate a test that needs CUDA with ``@pytest.mark.gpu`` (optionally
    ``@pytest.mark.gpu(reason="...")``) rather than calling this in a skip;
    ``tests/test_issue833_gpu_marker.py`` holds that line.

    The question a ``gpu`` marker actually asks is "is there a device to run
    on", which is ``device_count() > 0`` — not ``is_available()``, which only
    says "torch was built with CUDA and can initialise" and stays True when no
    device is visible (e.g. under ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""``). Gating on the
    build let the marker fail open, running a ``gpu`` test on a machine with no
    visible device and failing it instead of skipping (#1128); requiring a
    device is the fix. ``torch.cuda.device_count()`` returns 0 rather than
    raising in that state, and the ``and`` short-circuits so it is only reached
    once the build is present.
